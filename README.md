**"Casio Basic Web Interpreter"**
is a software able to interpret program written with the BASIC language used on casio calculators.
Output is done on an HTML5 canvas.

The javascript parser at the heart of this project is generated with JsCC.

### Generate the parser

The parser and the web interface for it are generated by (you may have to install `rhino` before, you are also supposed to have `git` and be at the root of the git project) :

```
> sh ./install.sh
```

Then, just open `public/index.html` in your browser to test it locally.

If you just want to use the interpreter, go to http://basic.crevola.org/

### Unit tests

Once you have a `public/` directory generated, you can launch unit tests by opening `test/index.html` in your browser.
