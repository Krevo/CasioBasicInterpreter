    <ul>
    Known problems : 
    <li>(nearly fixed) Only last answer should be printed, not intermediate expressions
    <li>num√©ric answers should be rigth aligned
    <li>Implements more error than just "Syntax Error": Arg error, Div by Zero, ....
    <li>Char with code >= 256 (UTF-16 character table) are not usabel in strings
    <li>Lot of missing chars in hiResConsoleFont / hiResGfxFont (and probably in lowRes font too)
    <li>Lot of missing instructions ... but it's normal as there is plenty of work to do.
    </ul>
