    <ul>
    Known problems : 
    <li>num√©ric answers should be rigth aligned
    <li>Do/LpWhile and While/WhileEnd don't respect 10ms timeout between instructions.... so are paradoxically too fast.
    <li>Only last answer should be printed, not intermediate expressions
    <li>Lot of missing instructions ... but it's normal as there is plenty of work to do.
    </ul>
